Hey, I’m Andre Nogueira — a Site Reliability Engineer by day, a curious tinkerer by night.

My GitHub is a bit of everything: side quests, experiments, contributions, and maybe the occasional over-engineered dotfiles setup. I like to build things that are fast, reliable, and a little nerdy. If you vibe with `:wq`, CLI tools, or random systems blog posts - we’ll get along just fine.
